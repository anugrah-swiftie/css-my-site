    <!--Each html element is just a box-->
    <div class="top-container"><!--div is a special html element that allows us to divide content into separate containers or boxes on our website so that we can structure each div separately. More info on W3 Schools-->
    <!--block elements - these are those that take up whole width of the screen on a web-page.But we can change their display property to inline or any other. For ex - div element.
    inline elements - only takes as much as they require in height and width. They do not block other elements from occuring on the same line. But we can't change their width. For ex - <span>
    inline-block elements - which sits next to each other and we can also change their width. Image is kind of an inline-block element
    display none element - it makes the element disappear from the screen as if it never existed. Another similar property is visibilty: hidden, it makes the element disappear but it keeps its original position and all other elements still flow around it as if it's still there, it's just can't be seen anymore-->
